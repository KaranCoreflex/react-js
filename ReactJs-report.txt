********** javascript Problem to solve:- https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLn2ipk-jqgZiAHiA70hOxAj8RMUeqYNK3

- let and const:- 
	- variables and constants have block scope which is surrounded by curly-braces "{}" and cannot be used before declaration.
	- we can't used var 
	- let:- this variable have block of scope
	- const:- we can declare at the top also but we can't change the value of const variable
	
- Donw with onclick, onmousehover, onmouseout, onload, onchange

- export:- we can export any function and variable 
- import:- we can import the exported function and used any file 

- destructor :-  
	We have object a = {name:"karan" surname:"Thopate"}
	Then we can choose any element using "a.name" or "a.surname" like this.
	result will be karan or thopate as per you above requirement
	
- Array methods:- 
		- pop() :- Delete the last element from array
		- push():- Added the element in array at the last
		- shift() :- Delete 1st element of array
		- unshift() :- Added element 1st in array
		- find() :- find the spacific element in array like less than 10 or grater than 10. but find() return only one element 
		- map() :- we have array and each and every element we have opration like square, addition that's time we can use map
		- filter() :- filter the spacific element in array like less than 10 or grater than 10. filter() return all element in array
		- splice() :- Change original array. and return result
		- slice() :- Does not change original array return new array. when we give any negative position of number the they count reverse

- Backtick:- 
		We can use value of variable directly
		e.g:- 
		.html file:-
			 <h3>Backtick</h3>
			<h4>We can use value of variable directly</h4>
			<h4 id="backtick"></h4>
			
		.js file:-
			var my_name = 'Alpha Beta';
			var text = `My name is ${my_name}`;
			document.getElementById("backtick").innerHTML = text;
			
			
- Ternary Operator:- 
	They are conditional operator
	Syantax for 2 condition:- ab > b ? console.log("ab is less than b") : console.log("b is grater than ab");
	Syantax for 1 condition:- ab < b && console.log("ab is less than b")
	
- DOM Manipulation
	- refer:- https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom_document.asp
	- Finding HTML Elements there are few types
		1.document.getElementById(id)
		2.document.getElementsByTagName(name)	
		3.document.getElementsByClassName(name)

- Introduction to react:-
	- React is not a framework. React is single page site or app
	- React is javascript libaray
	
- Diffreance btn npm and npx
	- npm :- When we use npm its take time and download all file to our computer
	- npx :- When use npx its dosen't take time and not download more file its faster than npm 
	
- react app overview:-
	- create an app using "npx create-react-app app_name"
	- There have some file and folder alredry created
	- We can write code on src folder
	- In public folder there have index.html file. This file is important file

- props:-
	- props is a read only and we can set default props also using 
	- Syantax:- component_name.defaultProps = { title: 'name'}

- useState:- 
	- It's hold a data and change data
	- There have {useState} Hook
	
- Component life cycle:-
	- Mounting:- Birth of component (means onload) 
		- componentDidMount():- run after render funtion
	- Update:- Growth of your component
	- Unmount:- Death of component
		
- Routing:- 
- In react router we can use "Link" to jump any page
- But when we use "CSS" in that thats time we can use "NavLink"

- Controlled and Uncontrolled form
1.Controlled from:- 
	which from are controlled by react is called controlled form 
	We can use onChange methed here 
	And we can't have data acess
	we have to use "value" attribute
	
2.Uncontrolled from:- 
	Which are control by component or user
	we can use "useRef" Hook in that 
	And we have data acess

Redux:-

react-redux featch api:- 	
	refer:- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kL28Qyw9-0
	
- dispatch:- It is a hook and its work like a switch case, that means you can directly get case/function
- useSelector:- To display the name and data or numbers

- Theree principle of redux
1. store :- hold state value
2. action :- make some action
3. reducer :- how to change the state, return new state

Hookes:- 
1. useLocation:- Used for featch data from prev page
2. useNavigate: Jump to next page
3. useEffect:- It's used for side effect, That means when you prefrom some opration after or before application run. 
4. useParams:- It's used for to get value or id from URL
		

- Combining Reducers:- It helps to organize multiple reducers to manage their own slice of state.

- axios:- It's used for featching api 
- Syantax:-
  const loadUser = async () => {
    const response = await axios.get(api);
    setData(response.data)
  }
